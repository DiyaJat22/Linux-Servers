# 🔐 RSA vs DSA – Explained

Both **RSA** and **DSA** are asymmetric encryption algorithms used in cryptography. While they serve similar purposes — especially in digital security — they operate differently and have distinct use cases.

---

## 📌 What is RSA?

**RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for **both encryption and digital signatures**.

### 🔹 Key Features:
- Uses a **public key** for encryption and **private key** for decryption.
- Based on the difficulty of **factoring large prime numbers**.
- Can be used for:
  - **Encrypting data**
  - **Signing data**
  - **Key exchange**

### 🔐 How RSA Works:
1. Public and private keys are generated using large prime numbers.
2. The sender encrypts the message using the **recipient’s public key**.
3. The recipient decrypts it using their **private key**.

### ✅ Common Use Cases:
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Secure emails (e.g., PGP)
- SSH authentication

## 🔐 What is DSA?

**DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)** is a U.S. government standard for **digital signatures only** — it does **not support encryption**.

### 🔹 Key Features:
- Used **only for digital signing and verification**.
- Based on **discrete logarithm problem** (like Diffie-Hellman).
- Signatures are smaller and faster to generate.

### 🔐 How DSA Works:
1. The sender creates a **digital signature** using their private key.
2. The receiver uses the sender’s **public key** to verify the signature.
3. The message itself is not encrypted — only its authenticity is verified.

### ✅ Common Use Cases:
- Code signing (software integrity)
- Document authentication
- Government and military use (FIPS-compliant)

## 📎 Summary

- **RSA** is versatile: it supports both encryption and digital signatures.
- **DSA** is specialized: it is used only for digital signatures.
- In practice, **RSA is more commonly used** in web and server security.

> For maximum security and speed, modern systems often prefer **ECDSA** (Elliptic Curve DSA) or **RSA with SHA-256+**.
