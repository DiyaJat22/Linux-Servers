# 🔐 Difference Between SSL and TLS

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over the internet. Although often used interchangeably, TLS is the successor to SSL and offers improved security.

## 📋 Summary Table

| Feature               | SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)          | TLS (Transport Layer Security)      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Developed By**       | Netscape                             | Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) |
| **First Released**     | 1995 (SSL 2.0)                        | 1999 (TLS 1.0)                        |
| **Latest Version**     | SSL 3.0 (deprecated)                  | TLS 1.3 (released in 2018)            |
| **Security Level**     | Less secure, outdated                | Strong encryption, modern security   |
| **Status**             | Deprecated, not recommended          | Actively used and maintained         |
| **Handshake Process**  | Slower, less secure                  | Faster, more secure                  |
| **Cipher Suites**      | Supports outdated ciphers            | Uses modern, secure cipher suites    |
| **Vulnerabilities**    | Susceptible to POODLE, Heartbleed    | Resistant to known SSL attacks       |
| **Port Used**          | Port 443 (same as TLS)               | Port 443 (standard for HTTPS)        |

## 🔄 Relationship

TLS is essentially an upgrade to SSL. It was introduced to address the vulnerabilities in SSL and provide stronger, more efficient encryption protocols. Although people often say "SSL certificates," they actually refer to certificates used in TLS encryption.

---

## ⚠️ Why SSL Is Obsolete

- SSL 2.0 and 3.0 have known security flaws.
- Browsers and servers have dropped support.
- TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are now the industry standards.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

TLS is the secure and recommended protocol for web encryption today. SSL is outdated and should not be used in any modern systems.

> Always use **TLS 1.2 or 1.3** for secure communications.
