**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Server** automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network. This simplifies network management by eliminating the need for manual IP configuration on each client device.


## **How DHCP Works**

When a device connects to a network, it follows these steps to receive an IP address from the DHCP server:

* **Discovery**
  The client sends a broadcast request to find a DHCP server.

* **Offer**
  The server responds with an available IP address and other configuration parameters.

* **Request**
  The client requests the offered IP address.

* **Acknowledgment**
  The server confirms the assignment, and the client can begin using the IP address.
